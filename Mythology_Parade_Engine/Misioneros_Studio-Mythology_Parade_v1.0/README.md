[Misioneros Sudio - Mythology Parade]

Misioneros Studio is an on-going project working team due to "Project II" subject in CITM University: 
Videogames Design & Developments degree. Our current aim is to create a RTS videogame called Mythology Parade
using SDL2 for our subject project.

Mythology Parade is based on a clash between different history religions and mythologies, where each one of them
will try by any means to extend its faith, wiping or reducing the influenc of its rivals using the game mechanics and
focusing on a Chaotic path or a Lawful one. The choice is up to the player.

HOW AI WORKS:

AI consists of 3 phases. Early, Mid and Late Game. In Early, the AI will form their bases and send clerics to find out where your base is. Once they find out,
they will change the phase and proceed to create their own economy and defense to start the attack. Once it's settled, it's going to change to the Late, where
it's going to send units to bother you and try to win. If you manage to defend yourself from the constant attacks and do not get the necessary points to win peacefully,
the AI will win.
